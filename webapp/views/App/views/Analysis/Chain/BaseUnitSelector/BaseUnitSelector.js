/*
    BASE_UNIT annotations
    The concept of BaseUnit is quite complex so this is the reason behind of this comments. 

    A base unit is a value contained into a Chain, 
    Some calculations based on some area are needed so this is the reason behind of the base unit.
    - 1.1 First the user has to select the entity that is the reference of the base units 
    - 1.2 Then for every entity below in the hierarchy of this "reference unit" a base unit nodedef analysis should be created 
    - 1.3 The first level (reference level) should have the name of weight -> the default script should be entity_reference_name$weight <- 1
    - 1.4 The children levels should receive the name with the subfix _area -> the default script should be entity_name_children$[entity_reference_name]_area <- NA

    So everytime that this selector changes e should delete all of the baseUnit nodeDefs and recreate all of this tree, 
    
    // TO DEFINE ->  I am not sure about the naming at this moment
    In addition of this, Into the quantitative nodes the user has the possibility to create "Area-based estimate nodedefs" with the following scripts -> entity_name$node_def_name <- entity_name$[tree_volume] / tree$plot_area
